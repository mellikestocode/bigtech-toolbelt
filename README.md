Ever get blamed for shit at work and it's not your fault. Not able to get a job 2 years after? Getting pushed out by CEO's using middle managers? Calendar invites with workers missing? Is it blamed on tech not really "working"? Take this with you to big tech.

Biggest lesson I learned is that risk, in these larger organizations, is mitigated by throwing bodies at the problem.
